However, some foundational works and broader reviews on neutron decay and quantum Zeno dynamics, such as
Misra &amp; Sudarshan (1977) or Dubbers &amp; Schmidt (2011), could strengthen the theoretical framework. Additionally,
references on neutrino interactions (e.g., Dolgov, 2002) and alternative dark matter models (e.g., Foot, 2014) could
provide further context and support for the discussion on neutrino backgrounds and mirror matter theories. In
summary, while the references cited are appropriate and mostly comprehensive, the inclusion of a few seminal
works and reviews would enhance the depth and rigor of the cited literature.
