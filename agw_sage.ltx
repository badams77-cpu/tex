\begin{abstract}
  In this work, we present a program to numerical integrate the atmospheric absorption due to carbon dioxide and water vapour
	of infrared photons by the atmosphere. We also investigate the effect of water evaporation on climate sensitivity. We present a prediction
	of increase temperature from doubling $CO_2$ of just under a fifth of a degree.

\section{Introduction}
   In recent years, the hypothesis that human released carbon dioxide will warm planet earth has become an huge issue. There is naturally a
large body of work in it. The UN has summarized these in annual reports \cite{IPCC}. However very few of the calculation tools for the issue are released as open source. In this work we present
a program and it results to numerical integrate carbon dioxide and water vapour absorption over frequency, latitude and height, producing a percentage
absorption amount for the two green house gases. In order works, with less computer time, transmission of in the middle atmosphere was performed using precomputed tables /cite{Ridgway}.
We however compute it directly.  Any such calculation requires temperature and pressure to be given at each height and latitude in the atmosphere \cite{Rosenfeld}, we calculate this to 25Km high, using \cite{Lente} Lente at al approximation.

\section{Input Absorption Lines}
Spectra absorption lines for many molecules are available on the HITRAN database online \cite{HITRANUnits}. We are interest in the strongest lines for absorption by the
molecules with the most common isotopes from the ground state, since it is the ground state is far more common than the higher levels. We download the HITRAN
frequency, upper and lower quantum states, with the Einstein $A$ Coefficient that gives the absorption strength of the lines. Using the line intensity $S$, from
HITRAN we order the lines from strongest to weakest, and select those starting at ground strength. We find 3 lines for carbon dioxide and 4 for water, and present them in the
table below. For the line to ground state we find the upper level multiplicity is 3, that is the undegenerate ground state, can be stimulated to one of three degenerate upper levels.

Where the wave number $\tilde{\nu}$ is the frequency divided by the speed of light $c$
\begin{equation}
	\tilde{\nu} = \frac{1}{\lambda} = \frac{\nu}{c}
\end{equation}
  
\section{Required Equations}
  
The Intensity of radiation in the presence of an absorber is, \cite{Tokmakoff}
\begin{equation}
	I = I_0 e^{-N\alpha L}
\end{equation}
Where N is number density of the absorbing molecule, L the length of the absorbing region, and $\alpha$ the cross section of absorption.
Tokmakoff also gives for a single spectral line,
\begin{equation}
	\alpha = \frac{h\nu}{c} B_12
\end{equation}	
 Where $\nu$ is the frequency, and $B$ is the Einstein $B$ coefficient. HITRAN gives us the Einstein $A$ coefficient, which is related to $B$
 (at equilibrium) by \cite{Goldman}
 \begin{equation}
 	A_21 = \frac{8\pi h \nu^3}{c^3} B_21
 	\end{equation}
 and
 \begin{equation}
 	B_{12} = \frac{g_u}{g_l} B_{21}
 \end{equation}
 The ratio of lower to upper transition to the upper to lower transition is the ratio of the number of quantum states in the upper and lower
 states.
 So
 \begin{equation}
 	\alpha(\nu)\Delta_\nu = \frac{c^2}{8\pi\nu^2}g_u A_21
 \end{equation}
Of course we need the spectral lines for each absorber, labelled $M$, so
\begin{equation}
	I  = I_0 e^{-L\left(\sum_M N_m\ \sum_\nu \frac{c^2}{8\pi\Delta_\nu\nu^3} \right)}
\end{equation}

The input intensity is the Planck Radiation Law  of EM emission from a surface at temperature T, \cite{Brit1}

\begin{equation}
	I_0(\nu) = \frac{8\pi h \nu^5}{c^4}\frac{1}{e^\frac{-h\nu}{kT}} -1
\end{equation}

The width of the spectra line is commonly approximated as a Lorentzian, due to Natural and Collisional broadening. \cite{KW} In fact the Lorenz shape estimate the tail of absorption, and
is often cut off at the edges, but we will not do that here. In HITRAN \cite{HITRANUnits} units, we lose the factor of $4\pi^2$ and the line width is proportional to the pressure $P$,
$\Gamma= P\gamma$, of the line width in table 1.

\begin{equation}
 \phi(\nu) = \frac{1}{\pi}\frac {\Gamma}{(\nu-\nu_0)^2 + \Gamma^2} 
\end{equation}

Then $\Delta_\nu$ can be approximately the line width $\Gamma$

HITRAN \cite{HITRANUnits} approximates the line width $\Gamma$ for air to 

\begin{equation}
	\Gamma(p, T) = \left(\frac{T_{ref}}{T}\right)^{n_air} \gamma_{air} p]
\end{equation}

So now we have the absorption equation for surface temperature $T$ and Pressure $P$ at each height, so need a model of earths surface temperature at latitude $\theta$, and atmospheric 
pressure at height $h$, to complete our input equations. To begin with we will average the temperature over day and night, we need a rough input function of latitude that provides an average
surface air temperature, we find this Fuelner at al /cite{Feulner}, as graph Fig 5, we copy the data for Observations from 1961-1990 which we approximate place the data points for each 10 degree latitude in the table below. We will then interpolate between the given points to provide a programmatic function to give a value for any latitude.

Given the Pressure $P_0$ and Temperature $T_0$ at the Earths surface we can find the temperature, $T(h)$ and pressure a $P(h)$ a height $h$, using a Barometric formula, we use Lente and Osz's formulae \cite{Lente}

\begin{equation}
	P(h) =  \left(P_0^\frac{1}{\nu+1}-\frac{Mg_0R_E P_0^\frac{1}{\nu+1}h}{(v+1)RT_0(R_E+h)}\right)^{\nu+1}
\end{equation} 
and
\begin{equation}
	T(h) = T_0 \left( 1 - \frac{Mg_0R_Eh}{(\nu+1)RT_0(R_E+h)}\right)
\end{equation} 
where $R$ is the gas constant, $R_E$ is the radius of the Earth, $m$ is the mass density of air $M=mN_A$ is the molar mass of air. $N_A$ IS Avogadro's constant, $g$ is acceleration due to gravity at the surface, $K$ is Boltzmann's constant,
$v$ is the number of degree of freedom of the average molecule in air $\nu\approx 5/2$, and $m$ is mass density of air. The formula works to about $30Km$, which is around 4 e-folds of exponentially growth, as the
scale height of air pressure is around $7 Km$. 

For pressure we just take the average surface pressure a earth surface. The above equations are enough for CO2 but for water, we need the humidity in the atmosphere. We assume constant relative humanity the
August Roche Magnus equation \cite{wikiaugust}.

\begin{equation}
	P_{h20} = 0.61094 exp\left(\frac{17.625}{T+243.04}\right)
\end{equation}
With T in Kelvin. Then the idea gas law will give the density of water vapour.

\section{Results of absorption integration}
We release the source code of our calculation at GitHub \cite{calcsource}. We step in 10 meter intervals to 25km, frequencies between $10^{11}$ and $3*10^{15}$ in steps of $10^5$, and a hundred steps in latitude, integrating triply using Simpsons law. We use C02 concentrations from $100$ to $1200$ and plot the graph of individual and combined contributions from the two gases. It takes around 6 hours on typical modern PC. We find that $CO_2$ matches similar results, but $H_20$ is some six time lower than modern estimates of water which is considered to the primary green house gases at $60\%$ of the total absorption. Green, Newman et al \cite{green}, state the individual lines from HITRAN do not well fit the absorption for water vapour, instead a sum of long tails of weaker lines, makes up most of the absorption, and "however, there is no universally accepted underlying physical model for the source of the continuum absorption." Also see P. Varanasi \cite{Varan} for more on the water vapour absorption. 
  In our results we find that doubling $CO_2$ from $400 ppvm$ to $800 ppvm$ increases total absorption by $1.1 Wm^{-2}$, one point one, Watts per square meter. See the figure.

\section{Climate Sensitivity and Rainfall}

The usual model of climate sensitivity is to use the Stefan Boltzmann equation to assume the increase in heat absorption all goes into the the heat balance between incoming and outgoing radiation \cite{wikisense}

\begin{equation}
\Delta F_{2xCO_2} = \frac{dF}{dT} \Delta T_{2xCO_2}  = 4\sigma T^3 \Delta T_{2xCO_2} 
\end{equation}
However we see an additional heat lose mechanism evaporation. At present an average rainfall of 39 inch lands upon the earth surface annually \cite{rainfall}. But rainfall increases $7\%$ for each degree warmer it gets \cite{rainrise}.
Using the mean temperature of $17.5$, and the usual heat of vaporization of water, we multiply the volume of water falling per square meter, $970kg$, the specific heat of water times the average $82.5$ degree heating plus the heat of vaporization, gets $2.526GJ$ per year, or $80.11$ Watts per square meter, we call $E_{evap}$. Adding the increase in rainfall to the energy balance derivative equation gives.

\begin{equation}
 \Delta T_{2xCO_2} = \frac{ \Delta F}{ 4\sigma T^3 + 0.07 * E_{evap} exp( T-17.5)*0.07)}
\end{equation}
For our 1.1 Watts of additional $CO_2$ absorption from doubling $CO_2$, we get a warming of just $.17 C$. This five times lower than the \cite{wikisense} Climate sensitivity in Wikipedia, and we thus find it would make little difference to the modern world to continue Carbon emissions at current levels.

\section{Conclusions}
We have performed an ab inito calculation of CO2 and H20 absorption of Infrared radiation from the earth Surface, we begin from the absorption lines listed at HITRAN, for CO2 our figures for doubling, $1.2 Wm^-2$ are lower than some other studies, for example The ACS \cite{ACSCO2} claims $3.5 Wm^-2$ an CO2 going from $280ppmv$ to $560 ppmv$, which from our graph would be around $1.5 W^m-2$.  \cite{ACSCO2} does not't not list a citation or provider the code for there claim which is slightly over double ours. However our figure for $400 ppmv CO_2$ of $2.9 Wm^-2$ is actually one Watt higher than Richard Tuckett claims in the Encyclopedia of Analytical Science \cite{Ency}, so we are not outside the range provided by the literature. Our figures for water Vapour $2.1 Wm^-2$ are dramatically lower than Claimed in the literature. This may be because,  Green, Newman et al \cite{green}, state the individual lines from HITRAN do not well fit the absorption for water vapour, but rather a sum of long tails from smaller water vapour lines, produce most of the absorption. 

To understand the temperature increase from adding $CO_2$ to that atmosphere, a calculation of Climate Sensitivity is needed. Most formulations of Climate Sensitivity e.g. ACS \cite{ACSsense}, purely use
the Boltzmann equation, we also use that, but we also consider the increase in cooling due to additionally rainfall. We find that a the quoted $7\%$ increase in rainfall per degree warming \cite{rainfall} decreases
sensitivity by a factor of about $5.5$, so our prediction of temperature increase for doubling $CO_2$ is as little as $.17$ degrees. Any increase in temperature causes additional humidity itself increase $H_2O$ absorption of IR \cite{NASAForcing}. If however the heat is reduced by rainfall, there will be far less extra absorption by water vapour. So while the water vapour feedback model, predicts, an unphysical thermal
runaway. Our model including rainfall, predicts that temperature increases are capped by the increase in rainfall, and will not thermally runaway,

Since Global Governments are planning trillions of dollars of spending on reducing $CO_2$, it is crucial that all factors are well computed and taken into account. Our work seems to support a more tolerant
approach to carbon emissions, due to both the lower raw $CO_2$ absorption, and reduced climate sensitivity.
